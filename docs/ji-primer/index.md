# Just Intonation primer

Just intonation keeps intervals anchored to pure ratios, helping ensemble tuning feel settled and repeatable.

## What you’ll learn

- How ratios map to musical feel and tension.
- Why lattice geometry mirrors harmonic stability.
- Quick language for explaining JI to collaborators.

:::tip Listen for beating
When a ratio locks, beating fades. Use that shimmer to decide whether a node should be fixed or flexible.

Think of ratios as intervals expressed in whole numbers. A 3:2 fifth feels stable because the waveform cycles align quickly.

:::info Reference ratios
Tenney uses 3:2, 5:4, and 7:4 as reference anchors. Expand slowly so the ear has time to adjust.

The lattice clusters consonant ratios around shared primes. When you move along an axis, you’re multiplying by a prime
factor and re-hearing how that color changes.

  Prime-axis multipliers are normalized into the current octave so every move keeps the ratio within a playable range.
