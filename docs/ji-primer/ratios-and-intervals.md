# Ratios and intervals

Just intonation expresses intervals as simple ratios. The smaller the numbers, the faster the waveform alignment.

## Core ratios to remember

- **3:2** perfect fifth
- **5:4** major third
- **7:4** harmonic seventh

## Hearing stability

When the ratio is aligned, beating slows down. Use that sonic “calm” as your cue to lock a note.
