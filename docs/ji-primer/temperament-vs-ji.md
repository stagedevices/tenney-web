title: Temperament vs JI

# Temperament vs JI

Temperament spreads tuning error across the octave so you can modulate freely. JI keeps ratios pure but requires careful transitions.

## When to favor temperament

- You need to modulate through many keys quickly.
- Ensemble members are locked to equal temperament instruments.

## When to favor JI

- You want the cleanest harmonic alignment.
- Sustained chords and drones are central to the piece.

## Tenney’s approach

Tenney lets you glide between both worlds: lock JI ratios, then loosen for a tempered transition.
