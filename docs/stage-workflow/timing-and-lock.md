# Timing and lock

Timing cues help you move through a set without losing tuning alignment.

## Lock strategy

- Lock after each cue if the harmonic center shifts.
- Use soft locks for sections that include improvisation.

## Cue placement

Place cues at transitions between sections so the ensemble shares the same tuning intent.
