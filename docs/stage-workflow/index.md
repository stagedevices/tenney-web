# Stage workflow / timing

Plan the performance flow before you step on stage, so tuning choices feel intentional and repeatable.

## What you’ll learn

- How to prepare a run-of-show in Tenney.
- Where to put timing cues and fallback states.
- How to keep monitors aligned with the lattice.

:::tip Run a dry pass
Walk through the show with every cue while the tuner overlay is active. It reveals drift before the audience hears it.

  Preflight checks
</span>

Confirm audio input, disable auto-lock, and load your show preset set before doors open.

:::info Monitor mix
Place the tuner overlay on your side monitor so you can confirm deviations during improv sections.

  Timing cues
</span>

Add cue markers for scene changes and hinge moments where the lattice needs to shift.

  Cue markers store lattice snapshots and timing offsets, making it possible to jump between sections instantly.

  Failsafe prep

Keep a fallback tonic and a "safe" tuning bank for quick resets. More coming soon.
