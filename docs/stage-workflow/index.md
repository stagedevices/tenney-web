# Stage workflow / timing

A consistent stage workflow keeps tuning decisions locked while you move through the set.

## What you’ll learn

- How to preflight your session before showtime.
- Where timing cues live inside a scale.
- Which signals to monitor for performance drift.

:::tip Timeboxing
Run a 90-second preflight before each set. It keeps the ensemble aligned and builds confidence.

1. Confirm audio routing and buffer size.
2. Verify tuner overlay offsets on anchor tones.
3. Load the correct performance preset.

Use timing cues to mark transitions between sections. When a cue fires, lock the lattice to avoid accidental modulation.

Keep an emergency tuning preset ready in case a device drops mid-performance.
