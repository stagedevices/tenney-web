# Lattice + tuner concepts

The lattice is Tenney’s map for harmonic motion. The tuner overlay makes sure the sound matches the geometry.

## What you’ll learn

- How axes represent prime factors.
- Why harmonic neighborhoods feel stable.
- When to trust the tuner overlay during rehearsal.

:::tip Practice with anchors
Pin a tonic and one additional anchor before you explore. It keeps the lattice centered while you experiment.

Moving along a single axis multiplies the ratio by a prime. When you move across axes, you mix harmonic color.

Use the tuner overlay for quick sanity checks. Aim for offsets under ±5 cents before locking a scale.

Add a second anchor to stabilize modulation points during performance.
