# Lattice navigation

The lattice is your tuning map. Moving along a single axis multiplies the ratio by a prime, while diagonal moves blend primes.

## Navigate with intent

- Move one axis at a time to hear changes clearly.
- Use anchors to keep a stable harmonic center.
- Label key nodes for rapid recall.

## Performance tip

Set two anchors before each section so you can return to home base after exploratory gestures.
