# Labeling HEJI ratios

HEJI labels keep track of ratio identity when you move beyond the 5-limit lattice.

## Best practices

- Label any ratio you plan to recall mid-performance.
- Use short tags that match your set list language.
- Keep a reference list in rehearsal notes.

## Example

A 7-limit ratio can be tagged with a simple suffix so performers recognize it quickly in the lattice.
