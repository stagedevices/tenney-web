# Getting started

Tenney’s fastest path to sound: connect your device, load a lattice preset, and export your first scale in minutes.

## What you’ll learn

- The minimum setup for a stable tuning session.
- How to generate your first lattice and lock it in with the tuner.
- Where to save, export, and share a quick preset.

:::tip Quick win
Start with a three-prime lattice and a single performance macro. You can always expand after the first rehearsal.

1. Launch the beta and confirm audio permissions.
2. Select a lattice preset that matches your harmonic palette.
3. Pin the tonic and verify the tuner locks before you rehearse.

:::info Device pairing
If you’re pairing with external synths, keep MIDI clock on and disable auto-sleep to avoid drift.

1. Tap a lattice node to set the tonic.
2. Add two more nodes along the cyan axis to form a triad.
3. Toggle the tuner overlay and adjust until the cent offset is under ±5.

  <summary>Under the hood</summary>
  Tenney calculates each step as a ratio relative to the tonic, then normalizes the result into the current octave.

Save the scale and share it with your ensemble so everyone starts from the same harmonic map. More coming soon.
