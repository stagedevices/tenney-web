# First 5 minutes

Get Tenney making sound fast. This walkthrough keeps you moving without skipping the tuning essentials.

## 1. Launch and grant audio permissions

Confirm the browser or device has access to your audio interface. Tenney needs stable input and output to lock ratios.

## 2. Load a lattice preset

Pick a starter lattice with three prime axes. It is the quickest way to hear clean harmonic motion.

## 3. Set a tonic and lock

Tap a node to set the tonic, toggle the tuner overlay, and lock once offsets stay under ±5 cents.

## 4. Save the scale

Use **Save → Performance preset** so you can reuse the exact tuning during rehearsal.
