# Audio input

Tenney’s tuner overlay needs a clean signal. Use this checklist to confirm stable input before rehearsal.

## Recommended setup

- Use a direct input or line-level source.
- Disable audio enhancements or noise suppression.
- Monitor input gain so peaks stay below clipping.

## Troubleshooting

If the tuner flickers or jumps, lower input gain or switch to a quieter room. For mobile devices, disable aggressive noise filtering.
