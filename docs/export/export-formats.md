# Export formats

Tenney supports multiple export paths so you can share tuning data across devices.

## Common formats

- **Scala (.scl)** for compatibility with hardware synths.
- **MIDI Tuning Standard** for live rigs.
- **Tenney JSON** for full-fidelity backups.

## Choosing the right format

Use Scala or MTS for external instruments, and Tenney JSON for archival or collaboration.
