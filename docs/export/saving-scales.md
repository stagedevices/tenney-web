# Saving scales

Saving captures your current lattice, tuner state, and any performance metadata.

## Save flow

1. Select **Save** in the scale menu.
2. Choose **Performance preset** for stage-ready recall.
3. Add a short description so collaborators know the intent.

## Naming tip

Include the piece name and tempo (e.g. "Nocturne-92bpm") for fast selection during rehearsals.
