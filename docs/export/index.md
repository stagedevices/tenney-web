# Saving + exporting scales

Presets are the fastest way to keep your ensemble aligned. Tenney export formats cover rehearsal, performance, and archiving.

## What you’ll learn

- When to save a scale versus exporting.
- Which export formats match popular synths.
- How to keep metadata consistent across a set list.

:::tip Version names
Use show-date naming (e.g. "2024-11-10-SetA") so performers load the right scale.

- **Session save** keeps your active lattice and tuning state.
- **Preset save** captures a reusable configuration.
- **Performance save** includes timing cues and lock states.

Export in standard formats when you need to share with hardware or DAWs. Tenney also keeps a raw JSON option for backups.
