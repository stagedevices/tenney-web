# Saving + exporting scales

Exporting keeps your tuning work portable, whether you are moving between devices or sharing with collaborators.

- Which save modes map to rehearsal or performance.
- How to pick the right export format.
- Tips for versioning and labeling.

:::tip Version your presets
Add dates and tempo tags to every save so your team can sync quickly before rehearsal.
