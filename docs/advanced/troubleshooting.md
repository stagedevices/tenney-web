# Troubleshooting

Quick fixes for common tuning and export issues.

## Tuner feels unstable

- Lower input gain.
- Move to a quieter environment.
- Lock anchors after large lattice moves.

## Exports don’t load elsewhere

- Confirm the target synth supports the selected format.
- Re-export with a different root note.
- Use Tenney JSON to verify the underlying ratio set.
