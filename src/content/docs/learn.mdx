## Learn just intonation

Just intonation (JI) is a pitch system built on whole-number ratios. Tenney is designed to make those ratios tangible with clear paths and stable locks.

### Where to begin

- Start with a simple 3-limit or 5-limit system.
- Listen for slow beats and lock a reference pitch.
- Save a set, then explore new limits.

### Recommended exercises

1. Compare 3/2 and 5/4 intervals.
2. Traverse a lattice row and listen for step changes.
3. Export your set and share it with a collaborator.
